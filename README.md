# BHpredict

An extension of the work of Doyle and coworkers on the prediction of Buchwald-Hartwig cross coupling yields.  

This project is a work in progress!!!  

This project started as a final deliverable for Cornell's CHEME 6880 (Industrial Big Data Analytics and Machine Learning) and was basically a re-implementation of Ahneman and Żurański's analysis in Python using the original 120 DFT features.<sup>1,2</sup>

## Dataset

X: 4140 reactions from High Throughput Screening  
        - 15 aryl halides  
        - 4 ligands  
        - 3 bases  
        - 23 isoxazole additives  
Y: reaction yields
